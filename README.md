|-------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Load file paths | Dataset with file paths and file types | Raw files loaded into memory | PDF, DOC, CSV, Graph, Time-Series, Audio, Image | CSV file with `file_path`, `file_type` columns |

---

#### **2. Data Preprocessing**  
**Description**: Preprocess each data type separately.  

| Step  | Input  | Output  | Data Types  | Processing Methods  |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Text extraction | Raw PDF, DOC files | Cleaned text data | PDF, DOC | OCR/Text Parsing |
| Tabular cleaning | Raw CSV files | Cleaned structured data | CSV | Missing value handling, normalization |
| Graph processing | Raw graph files | Processed adjacency matrices or embeddings | Graph | Node2Vec, GCN preprocessing |
| Time-series processing | Raw time-series data | Normalized time-series values | CSV (Time-Series) | Resampling, smoothing |
| Audio preprocessing | Raw audio files | MFCC or spectrogram features | Audio | MFCC, STFT |
| Image preprocessing | Raw image files | Processed image tensors | Image | Resizing, normalization |

#### **3. Feature Extraction**  
**Description**: Extract features from each preprocessed data type.  

| Step  | Input  | Output  | Data Types  | Feature Extraction Methods  |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Text feature extraction | Cleaned text data | TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT embeddings | PDF, DOC | NLP embeddings |

| Image feature extraction | Processed image tensors | CNN feature maps | Image | ResNet, VGG embeddings |

---

#### **4. Feature Combination**  
**Description**: Merge extracted features into a single dataset.  

| Step  | Input  | Output  | Data Types  | Format  |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Merge extracted features | Individual feature sets | Unified dataset with combined features | All | Merged structured dataset |

---

#### **5. Model Training & Evaluation**  
**Description**: Train ML models using the combined dataset.  

| Step  | Input  | Output  | Data Types  | Model Type  |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|------------|
| Model training | Unified dataset with features | Trained ML model | All | Random Forest, CNN, GNN, Transformer |
| Model evaluation | Trained model, test data | Performance metrics | All | Accuracy, Precision, Recall |

#### **6. Real-Time Data Processing**  
**Description**: Process real-time inputs and make predictions.  

| Step  | Input  | Output  | Data Types  | Process  |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Live data ingestion | Real-time input files | Processed real-time data | PDF, DOC, CSV, Graph, Time-Series, Audio, Image | Stream ingestion |
| Feature extraction | Preprocessed real-time data | Extracted features | All | Same as feature extraction step |
| Prediction | Extracted features | Model predictions | All | Inference pipeline |

This structured pipeline ensures all data types are processed efficiently and combined into a single ML workflow.
